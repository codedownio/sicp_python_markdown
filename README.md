# SICP in Python as Markdown

This is a Markdown version of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman.

It's created by transforming the HTML version from [http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/book/](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/book/) using `pandoc` plus some manual text munging to make the Markdown as clear and simple as possible.
